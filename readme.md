## Branching Strategy

- **No direct commits to the `main` branch are allowed.**
- Each collaborator must create a new branch for their work:

  git checkout -b your-feature-branch
  ```
- After making changes, push your branch and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`.
- All changes must be reviewed and approved via PR before merging.

## Collaborators' Folder Structure

- Each collaborator should create a folder with their name under the `collaborators` directory in this repository.
- Commit all files related to your learning activities inside your personal folder.
  ```
